# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of the Project
### Background of the Project
The purpose of this project initially was to help Steve's parents decide whether they would like to invest in the DQ stock (a green energy stock they were interested in). The performance of the DQ stock based on the yearly return in 2018 was in the negative (it fell by 62.6%), and so investing in that was out of the question. The project was thus expanded to include gauging the performace of the other 11 stocks as well, from which Steve's parents can then decide wherein to invest. 
### Purpose and Description of the Project
![Input Box](https://github.com/SohaT7/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/InputBox_YearValue.png)

This project analyzes the performance of multiple stocks in the year 2017 and 2018. The code takes in the year value we are looking to run the analysis for and then calculates the Total Daily Volume (the frequency with which a stock is shared in a given day) and the Yearly Return (the percentage change in the value of the stock from the beginning to the end of the year) for all the 12 stocks in that year. 
For this project, a code was written which was then refactored to help run the program more efficiently. The buttons in our sheet help run both these codes (the refactored code runs faster).

## Results
### Comparing the Stock Performance between 2017 and 2018

Most of the stocks in 2017 had a positive performance i.e. a positive yearly return except for TERP which fell by 7.2%. The highest performing stock in 2017 was DQ with a yearly return of 199.4%, followed by SEDg with a return of 184.5%. The only other stocks that yielded a return greater than 100% in 2017 were ENPH (129.5%) and FSLR (101.3%). Even though the TERP stock has a total daily volume of $139,402,800 which is higher than that of 4 other stocks (AY, DQ, HASI, and VSLR), it can not be used to gauge the value of the stock as well as the yearly return can be. For instance, DQ which has a lower total daily volume of $35,796,200 has a yearly return that is much higher (199.4%).

By comparison, most of the stocks in 2018 performed in the negative, i.e. the yearly return for most stocks is in the negative. There is a positive return on only ENPH (81.9%) and RUN (84.0%). The lowest performing stocks in 2018 were DQ which fell by 62.6%, and closely followed by JKS which fell by 60.5%. There are 3 other stocks that fell by more than 20% (FSLR, HASI, SPWR). The total daily volume again is not reflective of the value of the stock like yearly return is. Even though the total daily volume for ENPH is highest at $607,473,500 and so is its yearly return at 81.9% the highest, this pattern does not follow: the stock with the second highest total daily volume SPWR ($538,024,300) has the third lowest return that year (-44.6%). 

### Execution times of the Original script and the Refactored script
The execution time for the original code is shown below:

![Time_Orinigal Code_2017](https://github.com/SohaT7/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/ElapseTime_OriginalCode_2017.png)
![Time_Original Code_2018](https://github.com/SohaT7/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/ElapseTime_OriginalCode_2018.png)

The execution time for the refactored code by comparison, is shown below:

![Time_Refactored Code_2017](https://github.com/SohaT7/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.png)
![Time_Refactored Code_2018](https://github.com/SohaT7/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)

The refactored code runs faster than the original code. The execution time for the original code come sout to be around 0.6015625 seconds for both the year 2017 analysis run and the 2018 analysis run. However, the execution time for running the refactored code is shorter: it is around 0.1328125 seconds for both years' analysis run. However, as the code (original as well as refactored) was run multiple times for the year 2017 and 2018 in order to get average or stable values, the run time values stabilize after a couple times or so, except for the refactored code run on 2017 dataset which on a subsequent run gave an even shorter run time value of 0.125 seconds. This discrepancy can occur because on the first run especially the computer has to allocate resources to run the macro which takes longer. However, once these resources have been allocated, they can readily be used and thus give us a stable (and smaller) subsequent run time value. It is to be noted that therefactored code also includes the code for formatting within and it still runs faster than the original code (which does not contain the code portion for formatting).

The difference in the original code and the refactored code is that in the former, we used the array of 12 tickers (for the 12 stocks) created to loop through all the rows in our dataset 12 times - each one run corresponds to one loop and by the end of the loop, the ticker was updated to the next one, so on and so forth. 

![Array for tickers](https://github.com/SohaT7/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/Code_Initializing%20Array.png)

The Total Daily Volume, Starting Price, and Ending Price were extracted for each stock in each run through the loop. 

![Original Code](https://github.com/SohaT7/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/Code_Original%20Code.png)

In the refactored code, we created three additional arrays for Total Daily Volumes, Starting Prices, and Ending Prices. This helps run the code through all the rows in the dataset only once. In the one (and only) run through the loop, the tickerIndex updates itself to the next one when it reaches the new ticker's rows in the dataset. In addition, when within a particular ticker's rows, the code collects and calculates values for Total Daily Volumes, Starting Prices and Ending Prices and stores them in their respective arrays. All this aids in running through the code once and conducting all the operations.

Later, the values in these arrays (tickers, total daily volumes, startign prices, and ending prices) are used to produce and display the output in the sheet.
