# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of the Project
### Background of the Project
The purpose of this project initially was to help Steve's parents decide whether they would like to invest in the DQ stock (a green energy stock they were interested in). The performance of the DQ stock based on the yearly return in 2018 was in the negative (it fell by 62.6%), and so investing in that was out of the question. The project was thus expanded to include gauging the performace of the other 11 stocks as well, from which Steve's parents can then decide wherein to invest. 
### Purpose and Description of the Project
This project analyzes the performance of multiple stocks in the year 2017 and 2018. The code takes in the year value we are looking to run the analysis for and then calculates the Total Daily Volume (the frequency with which a stock is shared in a given day) and the Yearly Return (the percentage change in the value of the stock from the beginning to the end of the year) for all the 12 stocks in that year. 

## Results
